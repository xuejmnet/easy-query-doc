features:
  - title: zero dependency
    icon: async
    details: The core package has no dependencies, free from any historical baggage, and implemented entirely from scratch.

  - title:  zero cost
    icon: copy
    details: Using lambda expressions and caching to implement "zero" invocation time for assigning and retrieving values of bean objects, instead of regular frequent reflection.

  - title: zero sql
    icon: object
    details: ORM frameworks can shield the complexity of SQL statements by providing object-oriented query languages and methods, simplifying data querying and operations, and providing stronger type safety.

  - title: zero config
    icon: tool
    details: ORM frameworks can automatically scan and establish mapping relationships between entity classes and database tables, eliminating the need for cumbersome configuration files.

  - title: multi language
    icon: language
    details: The framework supports both Java and Kotlin languages, providing similar APIs for both. It maintains a unified set of internal interfaces to ensure that the APIs on both sides are merely extensions of the core functionality.


  - title: strong type
    icon: structure
    details: Object property lambda queries leverage the advantages of strong-typed languages in Java and Kotlin, making maintenance convenient for future development. Users can fully perceive errors during development and benefit from improved type safety.

  - title: sharding table database
    icon: condition
    details: A self-contained ORM with built-in support for sharding and read-write separation, possessing the capability to compete with the majority of sharding frameworks available in the market. It abstracts the business logic, allowing users to fully customize and implement their own business logic.

  - title: column encryption
    icon: lock
    details: The ORM framework comes with built-in database column encryption and supports fuzzy queries for high performance, rather than relying solely on database function calls. Additionally, users can customize their own encryption functions.

  - title: View Object Auto Select
    icon: search
    details: The framework enhances the capabilities of Value Objects (VO) beyond being mere data transfer objects. Users can automate column selection queries specifically for VO fields, and it supports customization of VO objects for added richness.

  - title: track different update
    icon: change
    details: Most Java ORM frameworks available in the market generally support full updates or updating null columns to non-null values, but lack support for differential updates. However, our framework provides differential update capabilities by tracking data changes, enhancing the robustness of update SQL statements.


  - title: atomic column update
    icon: react
    details: The updateById method for entity object updates is a convenient but indiscriminate method. However, our framework takes it to the next level by providing differential updates, allowing updates to be performed at a granular level. Furthermore, it supports atomic updates at the scale of inventory quantities even without optimistic locking.

  - title: value convert
    icon: style
    details: The framework provides object value conversion, which goes beyond mapping database values to enumerations. It supports a range of custom processing, including mapping database values to JSON objects and other custom transformations. It seamlessly integrates with encrypted columns, allowing for perfect handling of such scenarios.
