It maintains a unified set of internal interfaces to ensure that the APIs on both sides are merely extensions of the core functionality."},{"title":"strong type","icon":"structure","details":"Object property lambda queries leverage the advantages of strong-typed languages in Java and Kotlin, making maintenance convenient for future development. Users can fully perceive errors during development and benefit from improved type safety."},{"title":"sharding table database","icon":"condition","details":"A self-contained ORM with built-in support for sharding and read-write separation, possessing the capability to compete with the majority of sharding frameworks available in the market. It abstracts the business logic, allowing users to fully customize and implement their own business logic."},{"title":"column encryption","icon":"lock","details":"The ORM framework comes with built-in database column encryption and supports fuzzy queries for high performance, rather than relying solely on database function calls. Additionally, users can customize their own encryption functions."},{"title":"View Object Auto Select","icon":"search","details":"The framework enhances the capabilities of Value Objects (VO) beyond being mere data transfer objects. Users can automate column selection queries specifically for VO fields, and it supports customization of VO objects for added richness."},{"title":"track different update","icon":"change","details":"Most Java ORM frameworks available in the market generally support full updates or updating null columns to non-null values, but lack support for differential updates. However, our framework provides differential update capabilities by tracking data changes, enhancing the robustness of update SQL statements."},{"title":"atomic column update","icon":"react","details":"The updateById method for entity object updates is a convenient but indiscriminate method. However, our framework takes it to the next level by providing differential updates, allowing updates to be performed at a granular level. Furthermore, it supports atomic updates at the scale of inventory quantities even without optimistic locking."},{"title":"value convert","icon":"style","details":"The framework provides object value conversion, which goes beyond mapping database values to enumerations. It supports a range of custom processing, including mapping database values to JSON objects and other custom transformations. It seamlessly integrates with encrypted columns, allowing for perfect handling of such scenarios."}],"copyright":false,"footer":"‰ΩøÁî® <a href=\\"https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/\\" target=\\"_blank\\">VuePress Theme Hope</a> ‰∏ªÈ¢ò | MIT ÂçèËÆÆ, ÁâàÊùÉÊâÄÊúâ ¬© 2019-present Mr.Hope","description":"github repository easy-query (https://github.com/xuejmnet/easy-query) gitee repository easy-query (https://gitee.com/xuejm/easy-query) License Apache-2.0 License (https://github...","head":[["link",{"rel":"alternate","hreflang":"zh-cn","href":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/easy-query-doc/"}],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://vuepress-theme-hope-docs-demo.netlify.app/easy-query-doc/en/"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Docs Demo"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"È°πÁõÆ‰∏ªÈ°µ"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"github repository easy-query (https://github.com/xuejmnet/easy-query) gitee repository easy-query (https://gitee.com/xuejm/easy-query) License Apache-2.0 License (https://github..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"zh-CN"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2023-07-06T15:15:33.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2023-07-06T15:15:33.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"WebPage\\",\\"name\\":\\"È°πÁõÆ‰∏ªÈ°µ\\",\\"description\\":\\"github repository easy-query (https://github.com/xuejmnet/easy-query) gitee repository easy-query (https://gitee.com/xuejm/easy-query) License Apache-2.0 License (https://github...\\"}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"github repository","slug":"github-repository","link":"#github-repository","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"gitee repository","slug":"gitee-repository","link":"#gitee-repository","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"License","slug":"license","link":"#license","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"doument theme","slug":"doument-theme","link":"#doument-theme","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"üîîQQ Group","slug":"üîîqq-group","link":"#üîîqq-group","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1688656533000,"updatedTime":1688656533000,"contributors":[{"name":"xuejiaming","email":"326308290@qq.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.19,"words":656},"filePathRelative":"en/README.md","localizedDate":"July 6, 2023","autoDesc":true}');export{e as data};
